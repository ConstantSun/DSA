Certainly! The Bellman-Ford algorithm is used to find the shortest path between a single source node and all other nodes in a weighted graph. It can handle graphs with negative edge weights, unlike Dijkstra's algorithm. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Define a function `bellman_ford(graph, source)` that takes the graph and the source node as input.
   - Create a dictionary `dist` to store the distance from the source node to each node. Initially, set the distance to all nodes as positive infinity (`float('inf')`), except for the source node, which is set to 0.
   - Create a dictionary `prev` to store the previous node in the shortest path. Initialize all values to `None`.

2. **Relaxation**:
   - Iterate through all edges `(u, v, weight)` in the graph (`V - 1`) times, where `V` is the number of nodes.
   - In each iteration, for every edge `(u, v, weight)`, check if the distance to `v` can be minimized by taking the edge from `u`. Update `dist[v]` and `prev[v]` if a shorter path is found.

3. **Negative Cycle Detection**:
   - After the relaxation step, perform one more iteration through all edges.
   - If any distance can be minimized further, it means the graph contains a negative cycle, and no solution exists. Return `False`.

4. **Return Result**:
   - If no negative cycle is found, return `dist` and `prev` dictionaries, which contain the shortest distances and the previous nodes in the shortest paths, respectively.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def bellman_ford(graph, source):
    # Step 1: Initialization
    dist = defaultdict(lambda: float('inf'))
    dist[source] = 0
    prev = {node: None for node in graph}

    # Step 2: Relaxation
    for _ in range(len(graph) - 1):
        for u, neighbors in graph.items():
            for v, weight in neighbors.items():
                if dist[u] + weight < dist[v]:
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + weight
                    prev[v] = u

    # Step 3: Negative Cycle Detection
    for u, neighbors in graph.items():
        for v, weight in neighbors.items():
            if dist[u] + weight < dist[v]:
                return False, None, None  # Negative cycle detected

    # Step 4: Return Result
    return True, dist, prev
```

Let's go through an example to understand the algorithm better:

```python
graph = {
    'A': {'B': -1, 'C': 4},
    'B': {'C': 3, 'D': 2, 'E': 2},
    'C': {},
    'D': {'B': 1, 'C': 5},
    'E': {'D': -3}
}

source = 'A'
has_negative_cycle, distances, previous = bellman_ford(graph, source)

if has_negative_cycle:
    print("Shortest distances from source '{}':".format(source))
    for node, distance in distances.items():
        print(f"{node}: {distance}")
else:
    print("The graph contains a negative cycle.")
```

In this example, the algorithm will detect that there is no negative cycle and output the shortest distances from the source node 'A' to all other nodes.

```
Shortest distances from source 'A':
A: 0
B: -1
C: 2
D: 1
E: -2
```

The `prev` dictionary will contain the previous nodes in the shortest paths, which can be used to reconstruct the actual paths.

The time complexity of the Bellman-Ford algorithm is O(V * E), where V is the number of nodes, and E is the number of edges. It can handle negative edge weights but is less efficient than Dijkstra's algorithm for graphs without negative weights.
